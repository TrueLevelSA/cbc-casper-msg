//! ## Validators
//!
//! Validators produce and recieve messages (`message::Trait`) from other validators in the
//! network. When a validator want to produce a message he needs to collect his justification
//! (`Justification`) and run an estimator (`Estimate`) to get a value. See [ยง Estimator
//! Function](../justification/index.html#estimator-function) in ยง Justification.
//!
//! ## Consensus Rules
//!
//! These rules classify two types of faults: the *invalid message* fault, and the *equivocation* fault.
//!
//!  1. The proposed value must be in the set of consensus values returned by the application of
//!     the estimator function on the justification.
//!  1. The validator cannot make two messages with
//!     *  two different values, or
//!     *  two different justifications,
//!
//! such that **_either message is not later than the other_**.
//!
//! ### Violation of Consensus Rules
//!
//!  1. **Invalid Message Faults:** The violation of the first rule results in the message being
//!     invalid, and can be detected by everyone who receives the message. The receiver runs the
//!     estimator function on the justification of the message, and checks whether the proposed
//!     value is in the set of values returned by the estimator. All messages which do not violate
//!     this rule are valid messages.
//!  1. **Equivocation Faults:** The violation of the second rule cannot be detected by anyone who
//!     receives only one of the two messages violating this rule. This violation is a type of
//!     Byzantine failure which we call equivocation. We refer to the violation of this rule as
//!     faults.
//!
//! When a node (`sender::Trait`) equivocates, it is basically executing multiple separate
//! instances of the protocol, and may attempt to show messages from a single instance of these
//! executions to separate peers in the network. To clarify what separate instances of the protocol
//! are: consider a validator who violates consensus *rule 2* by generating messages **A** and
//! **B** that break the rule. The validator then starts maintaining two histories of protocol
//! execution, one in which only message **A** is generated, and the other in which only message
//! **B** is generated. In each single version of protocol execution, the validator has not
//! equivocated.
